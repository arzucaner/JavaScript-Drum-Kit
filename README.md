# JavaScript-Drum-Kit
This is the first project of JavaScript30 Challenge by Wes Bos.  In this project, when you hit the corresponding key on your keyboard, it will do two things:   It will play the sound that's associated with that key It will do short little animation where it pops the button up to be bigger than we want and also apply yellow border.
